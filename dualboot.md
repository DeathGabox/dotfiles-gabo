well, in here i am gonna write about how to manage the instalation with archlinux and windows 11, without windows 11 being an asshole
First of all, i am absolute non-expert but tech-savvy so, i am gonna just do it, fuck it and doing again


I dont like vanilla Windows, it so much bloatware, i love WinterOS by [Mauro Cerqueiro](https://www.youtube.com/@WinterOS/videos), in this Guide i am gonna install Rev12

First, install archlinux from [installation.md](/installation-guide.md), but remember
make another partition with 150gb-200gb free space,
